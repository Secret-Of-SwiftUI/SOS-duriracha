        You enter a local baking competition at the county fair 🎪. It’s a beautiful summer day and you are excited! When you enter the room, you look around to see ten identical stations.
        
        Each station is stocked with bowls of different sizes, spatulas, spoons, and a standing mixer. You are the third to arrive, so there are many stations still available. Where do you sit?
